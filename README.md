# Text-Classification - Topic-labelling

This Project focuses on developing and evaluating different text classification models capable of accurately categorizing documents into predefined topics across five domains: business, entertainment, politics, sport, and tech. 

## Project Objectives
1)	Exploring various text processing techniques to pre-process the text dataset before Text vectorization/ feature extraction techniques
2)	Utilizing different Text vectorization techniques, such as TF-IDF, Bag of words, and Word Embeddings using pre-trained models
3)	Splitting the dataset into 70% training and 30% testing
4)	Training machine learning classifiers, such as support vector machines (SVMs), Naïve Bayes and Neural Networks using different text vectorization techniques.
5)	Evaluating the performance of the classifiers using appropriate evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, on the test dataset.
6)	Comparing and contrasting machine learning classifiers performance on different Text Vectorization techniques

## Background information
The dataset was downloaded from [Kaggle website](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamkushwaha/bbc-full-text-document-classification/data) and extracted from its zip folder, it contains five  sub-folders – business, entertainment, politics, sport, and tech, which contains various documents relating to each domain.
   - Business	  - 510
   - Entertainment -	386
   - Politics	 - 417
   - Sport	 -  511
   -  Tech	 -  401
